## About 42 and the Piscine

42 is an innovative and immersive coding school that uses a unique educational model, emphasizing peer-to-peer learning, project-based education, and a rigorous, self-paced curriculum. The "piscine," which means "swimming pool" in French, is an intensive and immersive coding bootcamp that challenges students to learn and apply coding concepts in a short period.

During the piscine, students work on individual and team projects, solve complex problems, and develop critical thinking and coding skills. The curriculum is designed to simulate real-world coding environments and foster collaboration, creativity, and resilience.
